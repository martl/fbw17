//Your goal is to let the customer order items from the menu and print out the contents + price
//E.g.: "Your order is Salad, Water // Total price is 10 Euro"
//Hint: try to select one item from the menu and print its name (menu[1].name)
// Use for(){...} loops to iterate the menu, and if(){...} conditions to compare Order names to the Menu
